Project Title – Hospital Management System


Seeing present scenario of asking gratuitous amount of money in hospitals, we’re bringing in a new application in which all the prices will be fixed for all private hospitals by governing body. Apart from this it’ll remove most of the paper work which will help in smooth functioning of the system.


For this application we’ll be using GUI programming using Java along with DBMS.    It’ll contain columns of patient’s information and a column for what problem patient is going through. Based on the data this application will automatically generate ward number and the name of doctor who’ll be attending the patient. At last there will be a bill option in which hospital staff will enter the services used, based on that a centrally controlled bill will be generated.

NB- As of now, database is not linked, but once I get proper knowledge of database, I’ll link it. 

Software required - NetBeans and MySQL, JDK
